The views and features are illustrated in the graph below. We separated "Kids' fun" from the rest by colour coding it. The feature was renamed as "Kids' Mode" and I'll be referring it as such. After a lot of discussions about how we should proceed and taking the scope of our project into account, we decided to drop the Kids' Mode and focus on the core functions of the app. Nonetheless, our task was to illustrate sustainability with AR.</p><figure class="optimised-image"><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/images/MfhiT0pVTL-600.avif 600w, /images/MfhiT0pVTL-900.avif 900w, /images/MfhiT0pVTL-1134.avif 1134w, /images/MfhiT0pVTL-2268.avif 2268w" sizes="100vw"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/images/MfhiT0pVTL-600.webp 600w, /images/MfhiT0pVTL-900.webp 900w, /images/MfhiT0pVTL-1134.webp 1134w, /images/MfhiT0pVTL-2268.webp 2268w" sizes="100vw"><img src="/images/MfhiT0pVTL-600.jpeg" alt="Planning sheet of features and views" title="Features and views of EcoScan stemming from user needs" classes="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2268" height="1878" srcset="/images/MfhiT0pVTL-600.jpeg 600w, /images/MfhiT0pVTL-900.jpeg 900w, /images/MfhiT0pVTL-1134.jpeg 1134w, /images/MfhiT0pVTL-2268.jpeg 2268w" sizes="100vw"></picture><figcaption class="image-caption">Features and views of EcoScan stemming from user needs</figcaption></figure><p>The graph above was quite straightforward to convert into a wireframe as shown below.

Its main feature is the optimal path visualised in AR. This is illustrated below, the first two screens on the second row. The path is derived from the user's shopping list. When approaching a product, the product is recognised through image recognition and the app shows the sustainability information along the reviews of the product. The user can scan the product with the app and pack it right away.

We included the features listed but the visual look is not perfect. More about that in the <a href="#lessons-learned">reflection</a>.</p><p>As you can see, we still included a rough version of the Kids' Mode. This was done as we had some spare time before the deadline and handing out the project. This feature is only a one-direction lo-fi prototype illustrating how EcoScan could be used by a kid accompanying their parent.</p><figure class="optimised-image"><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/images/lzHvspOZZl-600.avif 600w, /images/lzHvspOZZl-900.avif 900w, /images/lzHvspOZZl-1134.avif 1134w, /images/lzHvspOZZl-2268.avif 2268w" sizes="100vw"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/images/lzHvspOZZl-600.webp 600w, /images/lzHvspOZZl-900.webp 900w, /images/lzHvspOZZl-1134.webp 1134w, /images/lzHvspOZZl-2268.webp 2268w" sizes="100vw"><img src="/images/lzHvspOZZl-600.jpeg" alt="Screenshots of EcoScan" title="EcoScan screens including onboarding, AR views, and rough idea for Kids' Mode" classes="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2268" height="1292" srcset="/images/lzHvspOZZl-600.jpeg 600w, /images/lzHvspOZZl-900.jpeg 900w, /images/lzHvspOZZl-1134.jpeg 1134w, /images/lzHvspOZZl-2268.jpeg 2268w" sizes="100vw"></picture><figcaption class="image-caption">EcoScan screens including onboarding, AR views, and rough idea for Kids' Mode</figcaption></figure><h2 id="test-%26-iterate" tabindex="-1">Test &amp; Iterate <a class="header-anchor" href="#test-%26-iterate" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Another quick round of interviews were conducted with the participants who participated in the previous interviews as well. We collected the responses to the table below and together discussed what the answers meant. The conclusions were written down on the last row.

First, implementing sustainability points, as an incentive towards sustainable habits, was discussed previously but it seemed to require so much research to implementing it meaningfully that we decided to leave it out for now. The implementation of a such feature would open doors for gamification features. Second, there are already an overabundance of recipe providers so our idea was to utilise existing providers to quickly add the ingredients to the shopping list. Last, Kids' Mode seems like an interesting an important addition to the design. It needs to be studied how we could design a system that kids would enjoy and make the shopping experience for the parent more pleasant. These are features we didn't implement and left for future iterations of EcoScan.</p><h2 id="lessons-learned" tabindex="-1">Lessons Learned <a class="header-anchor" href="#lessons-learned" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Thorough literature review in the beginning is worth the effort although it might feel like a burden - I'm guilty of procrastinating on that too much. During this project, I tried to find reasons for why I have this behaviour and came to the conclusion I'm personally more practice-oriented as a designer; I strive more in brainstorming and testing different solutions.</p><p>Do not try to do one-app-to-rule-them-all. Since our team was full of ideas, it was difficult for us all to decide which ones to focus on. I personally learned that it's better to have too much ideas initially and chip away until the idea fits the scope. It's good to prioritise features and create the MVP design first.</p><p>Scarcity of tools is a virtue; having everything on a single FigJam file makes it difficult to forget or ignore insights and what has previously been discussed. Moreover, a visual schedule helps understand the schedule better. Literally seeing the deadline getting closer gives a good perspective on how much time is left.</p><p>Perfectionism needs to be put aside sometimes. The focus of this project was not visual appeal but, nevertheless, I got frustrated when others didn't follow the visual style I created early on. I had to choose whether to fix it or leave it. I chose the latter although it felt uncomfortable at first. However, not following the visual guide or best practices on prototyping with Figma, it makes it more difficult to continue the project.</p></div><nav class="content-nav"><a href="/portfolio/thesis/"><span class="label">← Previous</span> <span class="title">Master's Thesis: Perceived Benefits and Drawbacks of Ethical Design</span> </a><a href="/portfolio/fugenjikko/"><span class="label">Next →</span> <span class="title">Case Study: Fugenjikko (不言実行)</span></a></nav></main><footer><p>© 2025 Lauri Parkkamäki | Built with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a> | Designed by <a href="https://parkkamaki.com/">Lauri Parkkamäki</a></p><div class="co2"><p class="content" id="page-weight">🌱 Every click has a footprint.</p><span class="tooltip">This site is designed this to stay light — faster for you, better for the planet.</span></div></footer></div><script src="/scripts/page-weight.js"></script><script src="/scripts/div-anchors.js"></script><script src="/scripts/theme-toggle.js"></script></body></html>
