As I've gotten older, my philosophy has been leaning more and more towards sustainability in all its branches. That being said, I cannot anymore be that blind consumer who looks only for the vegan label whether it's food, clothes, or other products. We share this planet with other forms of life so we should do everything to protect it. This is a bit far-fetched but thus, in the long run, unsustainable habits could be considered non-vegan. Here are some thoughts about how unsustainable behaviour might manifest in a vegan lifestyle.</p><p>Veganism by definition does not imply the choices made are sustainable. While one can feel relieved about not supporting animal cruelty they might indirectly support non-vegan aesthetics or produce more unmanageable waste than meat eaters. The choices aren't always conscious as it's difficult to factor in all the variables, especially if the impact isn't direct or immediate. However, we can still learn and improve our habits daily.</p><figure class="optimised-image"><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/images/2TpmgRnR67-600.avif 600w" sizes="100vw"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/images/2TpmgRnR67-600.webp 600w" sizes="100vw"><img src="/images/2TpmgRnR67-600.jpeg" alt="Honey jar and a honey spoon" title="Photo by Arwin Neil Baichoo on Unsplash" classes="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"></picture><figcaption class="image-caption">Photo by Arwin Neil Baichoo on Unsplash</figcaption></figure><p>I know most vegans consider honey a non-vegan product but hear me out. Where I reside, all honey comes from artisans and small farms. That in itself raises the prices but the fact that there are practically no honey from big farms on the shelves in grocery stores ensures that the bees haven't been abused. You might think people shouldn't rob the bees of honey but actually beekeepers provide food for the hive and so the colony thrives better than without the help of humans. Additionally, having small honey farms increases the amount of pollinators over the country. That, in turn, increases biodiversity which is good for the sustainability of the environment. Backed by this reasoning, I very much consider buying honey a positive action regarding sustainability. I do acknowledge that this only applies in the area where I live. The question is, why shouldn't I support this matter?</p><figure class="optimised-image"><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/images/xUYE_n9yJe-600.avif 600w" sizes="100vw"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/images/xUYE_n9yJe-600.webp 600w" sizes="100vw"><img src="/images/xUYE_n9yJe-600.jpeg" alt="Sheets of leather in different colours" title="Photo by Kelly Sikkema on Unsplash" classes="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"></picture><figcaption class="image-caption">Photo by Kelly Sikkema on Unsplash</figcaption></figure><p>You've all heard about vegan leather, right? There lies two major issues with that material. Firstly, it tries to mimic real leather and does it pretty well. That means if you buy it you're supporting non-vegan fashion ‚Äî you're stating that leather looks cool. That's not a vegan thing to do, I'd argue. Secondly, it's plastic. Vegan leather, fake leather, is plastic and, moreover, it's non-recyclable. And that is not sustainable environmentally nor socially. From the point of sustainability, real leather is the better option here. Even more so if leather is only a side product of the meat industry. Nonetheless, preferring plant-based plastic-free materials would serve both the sustainability and vegan purposes.</p><p>I think what I wanted to convey with this monologue is that no lifestyle choice is black and white; you have to draw the line somewhere. Supporting small beekeepers might turn out to be a net positive thing for the planet and the bees so you shouldn't condemn people, especially vegans, for using honey. However, if you consume honey please do the research on how the bees are being treated where your honey comes from! Having leather boots or a leather jacket is not a sin either. It's always worse for the planet to throw things away or buy a new vegan alternative than to use your existing leather garment until the end of its life cycle.</p><p>I wish to see more conversations about veganism and sustainability. Feel free to continue the discussion with your observations or counter arguments. My mind is always open for new perspectives if they are presented with good arguments!</p></div><nav class="content-nav"><a href="/blog/accesibility-around-us/"><span class="label">‚Üê Previous</span> <span class="title">Accessibility Around Us</span> </a><a href="/blog/improved-spinoff-technologies/"><span class="label">Next ‚Üí</span> <span class="title">Improved Spinoff Technologies</span></a></nav></main><footer><p>¬© 2025 Lauri Parkkam√§ki | Built with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a> | Designed by <a href="https://parkkamaki.com/">Lauri Parkkam√§ki</a></p><div class="co2"><p class="content" id="page-weight">üå± Every click has a footprint.</p><span class="tooltip">This site is designed this to stay light ‚Äî faster for you, better for the planet.</span></div></footer></div><script src="/scripts/page-weight.js"></script><script src="/scripts/div-anchors.js"></script><script src="/scripts/theme-toggle.js"></script></body></html>
