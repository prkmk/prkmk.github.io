# Lauri Parkkamäki
As a UX designer, I believe in the power of design to shape behavior—toward sustainability, ethics, and simplicity. My work is rooted in the idea that even small interactions can create meaningful change.

Over the past two years, I’ve led the UX overhaul for welding automation software, creating a design system that brings cohesion and modernity to an industry ready for innovation.
